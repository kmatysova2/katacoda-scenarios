In our increasingly digitalized world data play a big part, especially in business decisions. [Koziel et al. (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261920314896) argue that too much emphasis has been put on data quantity ("Big Data") and not enough value has been placed on data quality. They are not the first ones to warn that bad data can have a detrimental influence on their interpretation. Charles Babbage, a famous philosopher and matematician in the 19th century, said that "errors using inadequate data are much less than those using no data at all". In computer science, the term "garbage in, garbage out" (GIGO) is used to indicate that no good implications can be drawn from flawed data. Of the work related to data, 75% of the time need to be dedicated to data cleansing (DHBW Data Management, 03 Data Quality).<br>
The figure below on the left shows that data is the main pillar of information and hence knowledge. If the bottom of the pyramid is not solid, the top of the pyramid will not be stable either.<br><br>
Clearly, data quality is important, so why does nobody want to take care of it?<br>

For me, everything starts with education. Since almost everyone in the modern world will be affected by data at some point or another, it is important that everyone knows about data quality.<br>
This scenario will take you through a few steps to help you realize some potential issues that can arise with data and show you some options to fix them.<br>
