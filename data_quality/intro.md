Data Cleansing takes up 80% of the work with data, so it is possible to say it is the most important part...so why does nobody want to do it?

There is not a lot of research on data cleansing individually; instead, it is usually examined in connection with a dataset. That is because data cleansing is so dependent on which data it is applied to. For example, cleansing employee data is very different from cleansing a medical dataset.
